C++ Sudoku Solver

How To Use:
 - Edit the 'board' matrix to represent the sudoku board you would like to be solved. A 0 represents an empty space. When complete, run the program and the solved board will be printed.
 
How It Works:
 - A backtracking algorithm is used to solve the board recursively. There are several helper functions used to monitor the validity of number placements and the status of the board.
 
What I Learned:
 - By completing this project, I learned more about backtracking and recursion through a practical implementation in the form of a sudoku solver.
